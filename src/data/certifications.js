    title: 'A review on Johnson Cook material model',
    description: 'In this research paper, we explore the calculation of Johnson Cook material constants to enhance process parameters in the metal forming industry. By integrating methods like Split Hopkinson-bar and universal tensile tests, we derive critical constants for material and failure models. Employing these in numerical simulations across platforms such as ABAQUS, LS-DYNA, and DEFORM 3D, our study aids in optimizing metal turning, milling, and forming operations, significantly cutting down experimental costs.',
